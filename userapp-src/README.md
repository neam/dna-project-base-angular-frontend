# AngularJS

Example of how to use the [UserApp AngularJS SDK](https://app.userapp.io/#/docs/libs/angularjs/) to add authentication to an AngularJS app.

## Getting Started

* Get your UserApp [App Id](https://help.userapp.io/customer/portal/articles/1322336-how-do-i-find-my-app-id-) and replace 'YOUR-USERAPP-APP-ID' in `js/app.js` with that id.

* Configure your web server to the example path and browse to it with your web browser.

* Try to sign up, log in, reset your password, etc.

**Note:** If you want to test the verification emails and reset password functionality you need to enable those emails in the SendGrid/Email Add-on. 
You find more info about that in the [AngularJS SDK docs](https://app.userapp.io/#/docs/libs/angularjs/).

**Note:** The Facebook login requires the `facebook` provider to be enabled under [Social Login](https://app.userapp.io/#/add-ons/social-login/) in UserApp.
